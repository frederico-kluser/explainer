/**
 * Skeleton - a recessed shimmer-placeholder vocabulary for loading states.
 * shadcn already ships a `Skeleton` primitive, so the name lands as a
 * first-class citizen; what this adds is the Motion choreography.
 *
 * The load story is the product, not a finished page. It ships one primitive
 * plus two independent reveal strategies, so you graft whichever handoff fits
 * onto your own content and copy:
 *
 *  - `Skeleton` is the shimmer bone: a recessed `bg-muted` block with a
 *    compositor-only `translateX` sweep, `useInView`-gated so the loop pauses
 *    off-screen, that sizes itself to invisibly-rendered children so the
 *    handoff has zero layout shift.
 *  - `useSkeletonSweep` is that gate on its own (the token-derived tween + the
 *    in-view / reduced-motion shimmering flag), for building a custom bone.
 *  - `SkeletonReveal` is the single-card handoff: skeleton and loaded card
 *    share one view-transition name and the old skeleton layer wipes away
 *    left-to-right under a `--wipe`-driven mask crossfade (motion-plus
 *    `AnimateView`). The `@property --wipe` registration and the
 *    `::view-transition-*` mask CSS ship with it.
 *  - `SkeletonResolveList` / `SkeletonResolveRow` / `useSkeletonResolve` are
 *    the row-by-row handoff: each row stacks its real content (in normal flow,
 *    defining the box) under a bones overlay, and the two crossfade on a
 *    per-row stagger so a feed fills in top-to-bottom with zero layout shift.
 *
 * Styling reads only shadcn's semantic Tailwind vocabulary; the shimmer
 * highlight is an OPAQUE `color-mix` off `--muted`, never an alpha wash.
 * Timing reads only the Motion UI theme (`@motion/ui-theme`) - feel is never
 * a prop.
