/**
 * Overlay - the accessible primitives every modal surface shares. This is
 * deliberately not a monolithic Dialog: it ships the three concerns every
 * overlay needs, so a command palette, a bottom sheet, a mega-menu or an
 * expanding card can compose one implementation of the accessibility
 * plumbing and keep its own entrance choreography on top:
 *
 *  - `useFocusTrap` cycles Tab/Shift+Tab inside your open panel, moves focus
 *    in when it engages, routes Escape back to your close handler, and
 *    restores focus to the trigger when it releases.
 *  - `useScrollLock` freezes background scroll on `documentElement` while the
 *    overlay is open and restores the previous value on close.
 *  - `Backdrop` is the dimming scrim. Its opacity is either a plain number
 *    (a fading dialog scrim) or a bound `MotionValue` (a scrim whose opacity
 *    tracks a sheet's drag position, or a view-transition scrim), so every
 *    scrim variant is the same component.
 *
 * These primitives are structural, so they own no entrance animation and no
 * reduced-motion branch of their own: the composing overlay decides its
 * motion and hands the result to `Backdrop`'s motion props.
